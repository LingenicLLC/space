# Space

A stack-based language with verified semantics, implemented in F*.

## What is Space?

Space is a Forth-like language with:

- **Multiverse model** — isolated memory regions called universes
- **Discipline system** — linear, affine, and unrestricted value tracking
- **Borrowing** — safe temporary access to memory
- **Warps** — structured traversal of memory regions
- **Native Unicode** — grapheme-aware text with full normalization

## Implementation

The implementation is written in F* and verified with Z3. It transpiles to C and native binaries via gcc.

```
Space source → spacec → C → gcc → native binary
```

## Usage

```bash
make spacec                              # Build compiler
./spacec program.space > program.c       # Compile to C
gcc -O3 -I runtime program.c -o program  # Build native
./program                                # Run
```

## Example

```
define-word hello ( -- )
  72 emit  101 emit  108 emit  108 emit  111 emit  10 emit
end-word

define-word main ( -- )
  hello
end-word
```
